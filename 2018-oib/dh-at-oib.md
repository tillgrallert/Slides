# Why digital humanities?
## technologies are here to stay

>Because digital technologies are increasingly central to the way we do our work as humanists, we all have a responsibility to keep pace with the information technologies that are changing the landscapes of higher education.

## technologies are here to stay

>The question of whether something is or is not 'digital' will be increasingly secondary as many forms of culture become mediated, produced, accessed, distributed or consumed through digital devices and technologies. Thus, [...] the digital humanities must be able to offer theoretical interventions and digital methods for a historical moment when the computational has become both hegemonic and post-screenic. [...] We think of the 'digital' as a previous historic movement when computation as digitality was understood in opposition to the analogue, rather than complementary, as we argue in this book.

# What are digital humanities?
## dh are many things to many people

[What is Digital Humanities?](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) 

- presents a random selection from 791 definitions from the "Day of DH" between 2009--14

## dh are many things to many people

- a misnomer: who speaks of "digital physics"?
- a label: symbolic capital
- methodological approaches: result in community/ies of practice
- a discipline: with its own history and institutional structures

## dh as label

>it is largely due  to the apparently instrumental or utilitarian value of the digital humanities (their ability to provide liberal arts majors with digital skills that can  be turned into productive jobs) that university administrators, foundation  officers, and government agencies have been so eager to fund DH projects,  create DH undergraduate and graduate programs, and hire DH faculty.

## dh as methodological approaches

>DH is the application of computational tools to research questions rooted in the humanities and the scrutiny of computational tools and digital media with methodologies rooted in the humanities.

<cite>Grallert</cite>

>What is important today is not that we are doing work with computers, but rather that we are doing the work of the humanities, in digital form. The field is now much broader than it once was, and includes not only the computational modeling and analysis of humanities information, but also the cultural study of digital technologies, their creative possibilities, and their social impact.
