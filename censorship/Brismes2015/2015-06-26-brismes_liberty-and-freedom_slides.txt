# Abstract

- Case study: the periodical press of Damascus and Beirut, 1875–1914
- Background: prevalence of strong views, but lack of empirical studies on the press in *Bilād al-Shām*
- Argument: No dichotomy of tyranny vs freedom, but ever-increasing will and capability to effectively control the periodical press as well as a shared belief in the project of modernity among authors, readers, and regulators.
- Suggested periodisation:
    1. official newspapers: editing and censorship are the same
    2. privately owned, officially subsidised: self-censorship
    3. private press: reliance on social consensus and censorship proper

# Sources

2 Damascene and 5 Beiruti newspapers; occasional recourse to various journals from Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, and Istanbul. 

- Beiruti newspapers: *Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār* (1881–88, semi-official weekly), *al-Bashīr* (1878–82, 1887–1910, weekly), *al-Janna* (1883–84, weekly), *Thamarāt al-Funūn* (1875–95, 1898–1900, and 1902–1908, weekly), and *Lisān al-Ḥāl* (1877–1914, bi-weekly, since 1894 daily)
- Damascene newspapers: *Sūriye* (1882–88, 1899–1902, official gazette, weekly), *al-Muqtabas* (1908–14, daily, with changing titles).

# Outline

1. legal framework
2. post-1908 developments
2. realities of censorship

# 1. Legal framework

# Relevant legislation

- laws on printing presses (*maṭbaʿa niẓāmnāmesi*s and *ḳānūnu*): 1864, 1888, 1894, 1909
- laws on printed material (*maṭbūʿāt niẓāmnāmesi* and *ḳānūnu*): 1857, 1909, 1912
- penal code (*cezāʾ ḳānūnnāmesi*): 1858
- constitution (*ḳānūn-i esāsī*): 1876, 1908
- executive orders (*irāde*s, *teẕkere*s)

# Power of the norm

Common strategy in Ottoman modernisation efforts:

1. Establish and reiterate legal norms; 1850s, 1860s
2. Gather information and build institutions capable of enforcing these norms; 1880s, 1890s
3. Start enforcing them once legal norms have indeed become social normality; 1890s and especially 1909 onwards  


# Pre-1876: establishing the norms

- 1857, Jan: Law on Printing Presses (*maṭbaʿa niẓāmnāmesi*)
    + permits required for publishers
    + ban on "harmful" (*muẕarr*) publications
- **1864, 31 Dec: Law on Printed Material** (*maṭbūʿāt niẓāmnāmesi*)
    + permits required for periodicals
    + authorities must be supplied with copies *after* publication
    + regulation of permissible content
    + no institutionalised censorship but private litigation in the courts
<!-- 1867, Ḳararnāme-yi ʿAlī; {Boyar 2006@421} -->
- 1875, 10 Sep: Supplement
    + suspensions for false news, stiring the minds of the people (*teḫdīş-i eẕhān*)
<!-- - 1876, 12 Apr: decree published in the press; {Boyar 2006@421-422} without source
    + pre-publication censorship of the press -->

# First constitutional period

- 1876, 23 Dec: first Ottoman constitution; abolished on Dec 11, 1879
    + art 12: "the press is free within the confines of the law" (*maṭbūʿāt ḳānūn dāʿiresinde serbesttir*)
<!-- - 1880, 19 December -->

# Hamidian period: setting-up the infrastructure

- 1888, 22 Jan: Law on Printing Presses
- **1894, 20 Nov: Law on Printing Presses**
    + abrogating the 1857 and 1888 laws
    + permits required for every part of the trade
        * permits continuously supervised by police and Directorate of Public Instruction
    + pre-publication permits required for all publications 
    + every part of the trade is fully liable to prosecution in case of transgressions
        * Police and judiciary tasked with enforcement
    + surveillance and random inspection of presses
    + supplying all relevant information in Ottoman
    + only periodicals' titles are allowed to be publicly announced in the streets
- 1901, Dec: *teẕkere* from the Ministry of the Interior
    + censorship (*murāqaba*) of periodicals is to be centralised at the Directorates of Printed Material (*mudīriye-yi maṭbūʿāt*)
    + all official publications are subjected to the same regime of censorship

# 2. Second constitutional period

# 1908, the year of liberty?!

- 1908, 23 Jul: restoration of the constitution
- 1908, 30 Jul: *ḫaṭṭ-ı hümāyūn* to the Grand Vezier
    + art 7: Henceforth, newspapers are not subjected to censorship. They can circulate freely. Claims against newspapers can only be decided by courts
- no publisher failed to obtain permits

# Renewed censorship
- 1909, Mar: *teẕkere* from Ministry of Justice
    + reminder that the various press laws had not been abolished
- 1909, 29 Jul: Law on Printing Presses (*maṭbaʿalar ḳānūnu*)
    + permits required
    + publications subject to approval by Ministries of the Interior & Education
    + enforced by penal courts and gendarmerie
- 1909, 29 Jul: Law on Printed Material (*maṭbūʿāt ḳānūnu*)
    + abrogating the 1864 law
    + permits required within a month
    + regulation of permissible content
    + all parts of the trade are liable to prosecution as if they were the authors
    + two copies of each issue to be supplied to the authorities
    + enforced by Ministry of the Interior, province, *mutaṣarriflik*
- 1909, 21 Aug: ammendment to art 12 of the constitution
    + periodcials cannot in any way be subject to control *before* (!) publication

# Initially organised resistance

- demonstrations in Istanbul
- crisis meetings in Beirut, drawing up petitions and open letters
- new section in *Lisān al-Ḥāl*: *qaḍiyyat al-ṣiḥāfa* reporting any violation of press freedom
    + explicitly claiming that prior to the restoration of the constitution, press laws were just and fair, whereas now dictorial censorship has been introduced

# Quick succession of titles

1. *al-Muqtabas*, Damascus
    + 1908, Dec - 1909, Sep: *al-Muqtabas*
    + 1910, Jan: *al-Umma*
    + 1910, Mar - 1912, Apr: *al-Muqtabas*
    + 1912, Aug - 1913, Sep: *al-Muqtabas*
    + 1913, Sep - 1914, Jan: *al-Qabas*
2. *al-Mufīd*, Beirut
    + 1909, Feb: *al-Mufīd*
    + 1912, May: *Ṣadā al-Mufīd*
    + 1912, Sep: *Lisān al-ʿArab* (5 days)
    + 1912, Sep - 1913, Nov: *al-Fatā al-ʿArabī*
    + 1913, Dec - 1914, Jul: *Fatā al-ʿArab*

# 3. Realities of censorship

# A priori censorship?

- required for all non-periodical publications by 1894 and 1909 laws on printing presses
- not-required for periodical press by 1864 and 1909 laws on printed material
- official attempts at *a priori* censorship are contested by the press in 1912

# Distribution of warnings and suspensions

- c.70 [warnings (*ikhṭār*)](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.3.1 frequency W yg 140303 all.html) and [suspensions (*taʿṭīl*)](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.4.1 frequency S yg 140303 all.html) each, 1878–1914
- uneven distribution
- after 1908 permits to resume publication become rare. 
    + Papers are immediately published under a new name instead.
    + separate institutions for censorship and permits
- some peaks correlate with legal changes
- no correlation with important events around the year: [warnings](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.3.2 frequency W mg 140303 all.html), [warnings (*hirjī*)](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.3.3 frequency W mh 140303 all.html), [suspensions](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.4.2 frequency S mg 140303 all.html), [suspensions (*hijrī*)](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.4.3 frequency S mh 140303 all.html)

# Were bans and suspensions actually implemented?

- many suspensions were followed by a corresponding [gap in publication](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.2 Censorship 140304.html) 
- not every gap in publication can be attributed to censorship:
    + *al-Janna* had to forego publication for two months waiting for the approval of its re-application for permit after the death of its publisher, Salīm al-Bustānī in September 1884. 
    + The *Adabiyya* press of Khalīl Sarkīs burned down in September 1895, causing a suspension of *Lisān al-Ḥāl* for one month
    + *Thamarāt al-Funūn* ceases publication for 2 months in summer 1892 without any comment 

# What were the reasons?

1. ignoring the censor's warning (1890s onwards)
2. publication of false news (mainly 1880s)
3. non-compliance with the press code(s) / principles of censorship (1900s)
4. disturbing public tranquillity and causing anxieties (*takhdīsh al-adhhān*)

![Ban of *al-Miṣbāḥ* over violation of "the principles of censorship"](../images/ban1.png)

# Was there a cannonical list of prohibited terms?

- There was no list of banned words (neither "nose" nor "republic")
- Surprising publications:
    + 1883, 1887: Arabic translation of the constitution, printed at the *Adabiyya* press in Beirut; ads until 1894
    + 1892: *Salname-yi vilayet-i suriye* includes text of the constitution and imperial decree to Grand Vezier Midḥat Pasha
    + 1908, 27 July: *al-Iqbāl* will not print Arabic translations of the constitution because numerous editions are readily available in Beirut

# Who was the censor in Beirut?

- until 1888: Director of foreign affairs and printed materials (*mudīr al-umūr al-ajnabiyya wa-l-maṭbūʿāt*)
    + Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī
    + Yūsuf Ṭanūs Efendi (deputy)
- 1880s: *mutaṣarrif* of Beirut, Nuṣūḥī Bey
- 1889 onwards: *mektupçu*s and *vali*s of Beirut
    + Ḥasan Fāʾiz Efendi al-Jābī
    + ʿAbdallah Efendi Najīb (famously vilified by Salīm Sarkīs)
    + Rashīd Bey Efendi (later Pasha, 1897−1901) 
    + Ibrāhīm Khalīl Bey (1903–08)
- post 1908: 
    + educational council (*majlis-i maʿārif*)  made claims to be responsible
    + public prosecutors and the courts

# Who was the censor in Damascus?

- no private press until 1908
- Director of foreign affairs and printed materials
    + Khalīl Efendi al-Khūrī (d.1907)
    + Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī (co-worker)
- educational council 
- self-censorship at *al-Shām*
    + proprietor: Muṣṭafā Wāṣif Efendi (director of the provincial printing press)
    + editor-in-chief: Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī (1897–1900)
    + ban: Oct 1902–Feb 1903

# Permissible content

- "surprising" level and frequency of *out-spoken criticism* 
- critical articles were not limited to the private press
- outright praise beyond the generic eulogies on important occasions was *less common* than criticism
- "embarrassing" news remained unpublished

# Permissible content: criticism & praise

- targets of criticism: 
    + main target: the municipalities at the intersection between imperial bureaucracy and urban societies
    + focus on lower ranks and after someone had fallen from favour
- [temporal distribution of criticism](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.6.1 frequency critique, authorities yg 140303 all.html)
    + sharp drop after mid-1890s
    + after July 1908: sharp increase
- targets of praise: higher-echelons, Vali, Sultan, etc.
- [temporal distribution of praise](../../PhD thesis/Tables Figures Frequency/chapter 1 press/drafts/table 1.7.1 frequency praise, authorities yg 140303 all.html)
    + somewhat complementing the distribution of criticism until 1880s
    + often reply to earlier criticism
    + sharp drop after mid-1890s
    + peaks in 1908/09

# Permissible content: events not reported on

- "embarrassing" events: e.g. 1893 conflagration of the Umayyad Mosque
- violent events challenging the state's legitimacy as providing public tranquility (*rāḥa*)
    + violence against persons and property: focus on successful law enforcement
    + inter-communal violence: focus on authorities containing the violence, no reporting at all
    + outright rebellion: focus on authorities' reactions, delegitimisation of the resistance as *ashqiyā*

<!-- # The network of journalists-cum-entrepreneurs-cum-officials -->

# conclusion

- no dichotomy of Hamidian tyranny vs Young Turk liberty
- gradual convergence towards effective censorship with the expansion of a modern(ising) state and its institutions.
- importance of the 1894 legislation <!-- coinciding with "effective" censorship in *Bilād al-Shām* -->
- surprising freedoms during Hamidian era
- "re-"introduction of repressive legislation in 1909 and their effective implementation
- continuous importance of limiting factors
- continuous importance of the social consensus within the network of journalists-cum-officials-cum-entrepreneurs
