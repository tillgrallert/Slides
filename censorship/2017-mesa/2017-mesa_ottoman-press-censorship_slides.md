## Abstract

- Case study: periodical press of Damascus and Beirut, 1875–1914
- Sources: legal texts and periodicals 
<!-- - Background: prevalence of strong views, but lack of empirical studies on the press in *Bilād al-Shām* -->
- Question: What were the legal norms,  institutional frameworks, and practices of censorship?

## Argument 1

Press censorship evolved in three steps:

1. Establish and reiterate legal norms; 1850s, 1860s
2. Gather information and build institutions capable of enforcing these norms; 1880s, 1890s
3. Start enforcing them once legal norms have indeed become social normality; 1890s and especially 1909 onwards 

## Argument 2

Control of the press depended to a large extent on:

1. A shared belief in the project of modernity that governed the focus of reporting.
2. A tightly knit network of journalists-cum-entrepreneurs-cum-officials.

## A priori censorship?

- required for all non-periodical publications by 1894 and 1909 laws on printing presses
- **not** required for periodical press by 1864 and 1909 laws on printed material
- attempts at *a priori* censorship are contested by the press in 1912

## Publication statistics: suspensions

## Publication statistics: implemented suspensions

![Press censorship: implemented suspensions](../assets/censorship/rplot_levant-suspensions-implemented.png)

## What were the reasons for interventions?


<div class="c_left c_width-60">
1. ignoring the censor's warning (1890s onwards)
2. publication of false news (mainly 1880s)
3. non-compliance with the press code(s) / principles of censorship (1900s)
4. disturbing public tranquillity and causing anxieties (*takhdīsh al-adhhān*)

</div>

## Permissible content

- "surprising" level and frequency of *out-spoken criticism* 
- critical articles were not limited to the private press
- outright praise beyond the generic eulogies on important occasions was **less common** than criticism
- "embarrassing" news remained unpublished

## Conclusion

- no dichotomy of Hamidian tyranny vs Young Turk liberty
- gradual convergence towards effective censorship with the expansion of a modern(ising) state and its institutions.
- importance of the 1894 legislation <!-- coinciding with "effective" censorship in *Bilād al-Shām* -->
- surprising freedoms during Hamidian era
- "re-"introduction of repressive legislation in 1909 and their effective implementation
- continuous importance of limiting factors
- continuous importance of the social consensus within the network of journalists-cum-officials-cum-entrepreneurs
