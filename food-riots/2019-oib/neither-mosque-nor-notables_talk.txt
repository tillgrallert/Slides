### abstract

Thirty years ago Edmund Burke III made three claims in his attempt to apply C. Tilly's "repertoire of contention" to historical Middle Eastern societies: invariably contentions started at the chief mosque of a city, the crowds attacked foodstores, and food riots disappeared with the 19th century.[^1] Retaining Tilly's analytical framework, this paper proves all three claims wrong by presenting an analysis of a <!-- growing --> sample of <!-- currently 23 --> food riots in Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Hama, Homs, Jafa, and Jerusalem at the end of Ottoman rule between 1855 and 1918. 

During these food riots, large groups of poor men and women gathered at central squares and in front of the authorities in demand for *equitable distribution* and *fair access* to *available bread*. Starting with an observable absence of direct causal relations between food prices and food riots and only rare instances of looting, which did not commonly target foodstores, I argue that food riots were neither particularly riotous nor predominantly concerned with food. Instead, the demand for *bread* had a symbolic value and was part of a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" that protestors could resort to in negotations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in the provision *just rule* and the *safety of life*.

## 1.2 Case study / vignette (3 min) 
### 1908, 21 Aug: Beirut

On 21 August 1908, less than four weeks after the restoration of the constitution in the Ottoman Empire, the daily newspaper *Lisān al-Ḥāl* from Beirut published the following article:

>Large crowds of the poor and destitute gathered the morning before yesterday [19. August] (*ijtamaʿa* [...] *jumhūr kabīr min al-fuqarāʾ wa arbāb al-ʿayyāl*) in front of the government Serail in Beirut. [There] they cried for help, lamented the current situation and called for the prices of flour and bread to be lowered to ease their suffering and that of all the poor; [...] most flour merchants and oven and bakery owners tyrannise them and profit from [the sale of] sunflower bread in clear breach of all laws and regulations (*jamīʿ al-qawānīn wa al-sharāʾiʿ*) to the extent that a *raṭl*[^fn1] of bread was sold at more than 7.5 piastres (Ps).[^fn2] This is unjust (*hadhā mi-mā taʾbāhu al-ʿadāla*) and unacceptable. 

>The protesters grew increasingly vocal until the vigorous Anīs Efendi Ramaḍān, inspector of the police, went out to meet them and soothed their minds with a speech full of courtesy and refinement. He assured the protesters that the authorities were directing their zeal and efforts to the lowering of the prices of foodstuffs and they withdrew gratefully.

>Their agreement lasted until they were met by another group of their likes, wretched and poor (*jamāʿat min amthālihim arbāb al-ʿayāl wa al-fuqarāʾ*), and joined them on their way to protest at the customs office. They scattered the flour [found there] on the floor [in an attempt to] prevent its export from the province and chased away everyone who tried to stop them. They only stopped when the director of the police assured them again of the seriousness [of the government’s efforts] to secure the necessary funds to reduce food prices. He explained it would take less than ten days for the serious flour shortage (*qaḍiyyat al-ṭaḥīn*, “flour calamity”), as well as all other problems they were complaining of, to ease. Thus they were appeased.

>Yesterday [20. August] the poor gathered again and decided to repeat their demonstrations (*muẓāharāt*) and thus today they roamed wheat stores and all other places where flour is sold. They also protested against the high prices of meat etc.[^cf1]

Despite the officials’ promises and explanations, the “flour calamity” continued: grain prices in Beirut remained high throughout August, at Ps 60 to 62 for a *kile* (bushel)[^fn3] of best-quality wheat and Ps 35 to 42 for lower-quality wheat from the Hawran.[^cf2] Some three weeks after the food riot, on the occasion of Sultan ʿAbdülḥamīd II’s birthday on 16 Shaʿbān 1326 (15 September 1908), unspecified “poor people” of Beirut approached the governor-general (*vali*) Nāẓim Pasha---already the third person in this post since the August incidents---with a call to rein in the merchants and to adopt sufficient measures against the high prices of flour and bread. The merchants responded by claiming that their suppliers in the neighbouring province of Syria were the ones to blame. Thus, Nāẓim Pasha contented himself with establishing an inquiry and appealing to the merchants to lower prices once the inquiry had come to a conclusion. The last available newspaper report on this matter states that the governor-general is still waiting for an answer from Damascus.[^cf3]

## 1.2 First observations (1 min)

+ shared belief in a paternalist economic model
+ people did not loot (immediately)
+ people did address the authorities in a mostly peaceful manner
+ people gathered in central locations outside their neighbourhoods
+ women were a substantial part of the crowds.
+ food riots fail

### Text

The incident is puzzling: Poor people, suffering from high prices of flour and bread, repeatedly take to the streets in demand for lower prices and in rather orderly fashion. They gather at the seat of the local authorities, complain about greedy merchants, and demonstrate for effective price controls. They do not initially resort to looting despite flour and wheat being readily available in the city. Even when breaking into warehouses (at the customs) they do not apprehend the food they claim to be unable to afford. They scatter it on the floor instead to prevent its export from the city, which they identified as one of the main reasons for its elevated price. Finally, they failed in achieving any immediate reduction in prices, which remained at an increased level despite the authorities' promises to the contrary. 


# 2. Question and methodology (3 min)
## 2.1 Research questions (2 min)

1. what is the **function** of food riots for the protestors? 
    + Why did the protestors opt for this particular form of contentious action even though it proved ultimately unsuccessful and why did they not violently take the food available in the market?
    + immediate remedy for hunger, lower and stable bread prices in the long term, political change
    + if they purpose is not the immediate satisfaction of a primal need?
    + why did they not immediately loot / forcefully appropriate foodstuffs?
2. what are the **implications** of food riots for the study of Middle Eastern societies?
    + Islamicate nature of protests?
    + gender relations?
    + assumed public/private divide?
    + where are the notables?


## 2.2 Methodology

        * the municipality announced that the reason for the long cues in front of the ovens and bakeries and the alarm among the populace is the lining up of those who had kept their wheat in their homes. People and the poor then began to crowd together in the hope to buy bread and the plenty of wheat became known to the public (al-ʿumūm).
        * the municipality and the police do nothing [against] those who dare to harass the people and the poor in this manner
        * and it remains to those who have hoarded wheat to use and eat it and not further keep it and the stores of those who do not do so should be ceased and shared with the poor

# 3. First results and argument (5 min)
## 3.1 Empirical results

1. There is no direct relation between food riots and food prices
2. Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" and take the form of a demonstration

## Food prices and food riots

- short comment on the political economy of food supplies in *Bilād al-Shām*
    + why wheat prices?
    + wholesale price of wheat tied to the retail price of bread
    + diet of poor majority based on cereals
    + demand inelastic / increasing in times of high prices (all other food is removed from the diet)

## 3.2 argument
### argument: function and "nature" of food riots? 

1. There is no direct causal link between food prices and food riots
2. Food riots are a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an *inherently political* act. The are NOT an spontaneous erruption of popular anger.
    + food riots do not aim at immediately lowering food prices
    + as they have no impact on food prices they function as a "reminder" to the ruling classes concerning their obligations to the ruled
    + e.g. "food riots" occur in Beirut in October 1914 before any acts of war could have a real impact on people's lives  
3. Food riots are part of a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" (C. Tilly) and a symbolic repertoire
    + Following Charles Tilly's work, I define *food riots* as contentious collective action: a group of people assemble in a public place and raise the demand of lower food prices vis-à-vis another group of people. All case studies in this research project <!-- must --> conform to this basic definition of a specific *form* of action as well as a specific contentious *claim*. Based on empirical case studies I argue that such food riots form a *repertoire of contention* or "a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice".
    + From this definition as well as out observations follows that food *riots* were neither particularly nor even necessarily riotous or violent.
4. The target of this conscious political *tactic* are the ruling authorities; protestors call for *equitable distribution* and *fair access* to *available bread*.
    + E.P. Thompson and Louise Tilly: moral economy
    + Amartya Sen: entitlement gap. Sen argues that famines are a function of  entitlement relationships
    + Eric Hobsbawm: people don't protest if they are too weak 
5. Food riots are thus part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*, etc. The demands are conservative and principally recognised as legitimate
    + they are genuinely conservative: return to just rule / governance -> again Thompson
    + they make tactic choices bases on a repertoire of contention (and thus they are dependent on strategic choices of the more powerful strata)

### argument: importance of food riots / why study food riots?

The study of food riots provides insights into the development of

- legitimacy of political rule beyond elitist discourses found
- gender relations
    + women gather and protest outside their domicile and in the company of male strangers
    + contemporaneous sources, both local and consular, do not consider their participation exceptional
    + this is similar to early modern Europe (Thompson: "an awful lot" of women participating in food riots)
- notions of *public*

### notes

- als *inherent politische Handlungsweisen*, gewährt die Untersuchung von Nahrungsmittelunruhen einen Einblick in die Legitimität politischer Herrschaft und ihren Wandel über breite Gesellschaftschichten hinweg.

- Nahrungsmittelunruhen sind außergewöhnliche Ereignisse, die häufig genug auftreten um Einblick in die Lebenswelten und -vorstellungen "gewöhnlicher" Menschen gewähren, die häufig außerhalb unserer Quellen liege

- Mit der zunehmenden Etablierung einer Marktwirtschaft und institutionalisierter politischer Teilhabe (formal politics) verschwinden Brotunruhen aus dem "repertoire of contentions" (Tilly) in England und Frankreich im späten 18. und frühen 19. Jahrhundert (Louise and Charles Tilly, Thompson).
    - mit der Beschränkung von "formal politics" auf (besitzende) Männer und die Verdrängung (bürgerlicher) Frauen in die häusliche Sphäre, tauchen weibliche Nahrunsmittelunruhen im 20. Jhd. wieder auf. Nun aber als einzige mögliche Sphäre der Partizipation von auf "Einkaufen" und "für die Familie Sorgen" beschränkten Frauen (Lynn Tailor; c.f. Khater "Godess of the house").    

# 4. The repertoire (5 min)
## 1 Repertoire of contention: prologue (weeks)


1. Period of *artificially* high prices
    + there seems to be a rather stable threshold to the "just" price
        * As numerous scholars have observed, direct control of prices or even price fixing is highly contentious within Islamic legal discourses and the practices of Muslim rulers. The concept of *ḥisba*, when it comes to *just* prices, focusses on enabling and protecting just relations of exchange so that sellers and buyers will be able to negotiate in a fair manner and thus arrive at a fair solution. In this system bread prices are closely tied to grain prices, which can vary widely.
        * But the picture becomes more complex when one considers the numerous attempts by municipal councils at setting maximum prices for bread. On the one hand authorities argued falling grain prices should result in an equally falling price for bread. On the other hand, however, the price considered *fair* or *just* remained extremely stable at below Ps 3 for a *raṭl* of dark bread despite the fluctuation in grain prices.
    + blamed on greedy wholesale merchants seeking undue profits from either exporting or hoarding (*iḥtikār*) cereals
        * hoarding is not legally prohibited
2. Advantageous moment: tactic decision to increase the potential embarassment for the authorities
    + on Fridays
    + in close temporal vicinity to important holidays / festivities with their mandatory affirmative public rituals: *ʿīd al-fitr*, *mawlid nabawī* anniversary of the Sultan's accession to the throne, anniversary of the Young Turk Revolution
    + administrative changes: new Valis, absence of important officials, disbanded *baladiyyas*
    + absence of troops

## 2 Repertoire of contention: the food "riot" (few hours, a day)

A common term for reporting food riots is the generic "incident" (*ḥāditha*). When food riots turned violent, witnesses referred to a battle *maʿraka* (battle), such as 1910 in Aleppo, or even *thawra* (rebellion, revolt) and *fitna* (strife), as in Hama and Homs the same year. Yet, *Lisān al-Ḥāl* acknowledged that the foot riot in Homs was "a rebellion of empty stomachs" (*thawrat al-buṭūn al-fāghira*).


3. A crowd (*jumūʿ*, *jumhūr*, *khalq kathīr*) of poor people---men, women and children---gathers (*ijtamaʿ*)
    + freedom of assembly is granted by the imperial decree (*ḫāṭṭ-i hümāyūn*) of 1. August 1908 restituting the constitution
    + regulated by a 1909 law: 
        * unarmed, 
        * need official approval 2 days before, 
        * only during daylight
        * not in open places and on public streets (*al-ṭuruq al-ʿāmma*)
        * no freedom of speech
        * accompanied by government officials
    + 1912 temporal law on assemblies (*tajammuʿ*)
    + crowd: derivatives of the roots *j-m-ʿ* and *j-m-h-r*
4. The crowd marches onto the seat of the local government and peacefully raises its demand for affordable bread and grain
    + the people raise their discontent (*shakā*)
5. The crowd is violently dispersed / a combination of promises and threats leads the crowd to dissolve. Original failure of the authorities leads to further escalation.
    + the press publishes loathing critiques of incompetent and unwilling officials
6. (optional) The crowds turn on merchants and loot (*nahaba*) warehouses, stores, and railway stations
    + primarly looting goods other than foodstuffs
    + generally considered illegitimate by the sources: 
    + property is protected by law
    + theft, including of grain, is prohibited
    + the crowds are deligitimised as: *thāʾirūn* or *thuwwār* (rebels), *al-raʿāʿ* (mob) and *al-ghawghāʾ* (mob).
7. Successful intervention of the highest representative of the central authorities with the help of imperial troops
    + dispersing looters (often coming to late)
    + Peace and tranquility as the defining basis of Ottoman political legitimacy---*asāyiş-i ʿumūmī* or *al-rāḥa al-ʿumūmiyya*---are finally reestablished

## 3 Repertoire of contention: aftermath (weeks and months)

8. Intervention from the highest representative of the central authorities
    + establishes maximum prices;
    + convenes an investigative committee;
    + reprimands merchands for artificial price hikes;
    + confiscates grain;
    + has looters apprehended
9. No reports on falling grain prices.
<!-- 10. Eventual prosecution of looters -->

# 5. implications of this repertoire? (5 min)
## The politics of notables?

- Generally strong argument for a persistence of the three-tiered Ottoman *ancien régime* well into the 20th century
- But where are the notables?
    + They manned the *baladiyya*!
    + Could have used food riots to improve their own negotiating power vis-a-vis the authorities

## What about the Islamic character of contentions?

- All contention invariably starts at the Friday mosques (Burke)
    + this is certainly not true and *food riots* had no Islamicate overtones (the right to life is certainly more universal)

## What about the public/private divide and gender segregation? 

- the "Islamic City" paradigm is frequently invoked ouside the circles of specialists
- historians of 20th century Middle East: 
    + "gender marked the old public private divide and therefore it had to become the bounding principle in conflicts over control of new spaces." (Elizabeth Thompson)
    + elite women were the first to transgress these boundaries
- historians of pre-20th century Middle East, me
    + public/private is part of the colonial / modernising project
    + the exclusion from *public affairs* was relevant for men and women of the third tier of the Ottoman *ancien régime*
    + poor majority of women could not afford the luxury of privacy

## novelty of demonstrations?

- Gelvin, Thompson et al.


# 5. Conclusion
## 5.1 Conclusion: summary (1 min)

- Contrary to common arguments and presumptions, we find a long "tradition" of popular contentions in general and food "riots" in particular as well as female agency in genuinely political struggles in public places / space.
- There is no direct causal relation between food riots and food prices.
- Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention".
- Food riots are a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an inherently political act. They are part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*

## 5.2 Conclusion: open questions

- social background of protestors?
    + unknown beyond the label "poor"
    + *Dangerous classes* and *Lumpenproletariat* both refer to the urban poor in their quality as neither propertied nor engaged in any sort of production. (C.f. {Brace 1872;Bayat 2000})
    + *Lumpenproletariat* and *dangerous classes* in the Marxian tradition might fit my case studies on food riots as the protestors came from the lower classes of society. They did not display any class consciousness and were reactionary in so far as they called for the restoration of the old order and just rule.
    - As I have no information on the social composition of the protestors apart from generic references to them being poor and destitute, I would reject Brace's category of the *dangerous classes* as a meaningful analytical category.
- what are the **implications** of the repertoire?
    * Where are the notables? 
        - Hourani's *politics of notables* 
    * Where is the Islamic character of the contentions?
        - Edmond Burke III: portest invariably started at the chief mosque of a city
    * What are women doing in public places and voicing their anger in a public manner?
        - discussion on private/public: beyond the scope of the paper/presentation
        - this is certainly wrong: it was only in the twentieth century, argued Thompson, and solely elite families that left the domestic space of the internal courtyard and moved the private, such as picnics, into the public.[^2]
        - requires a comparison with other forms of social action

### notes
    
3. questions aiming at establishing whether food riots show exceptional / deviant behaviour: what is the **context** of these events?
    * Is the street a public space---physically and socially accessible to all?
        - what are the topographical conditions?
    * Are people allowed / used to gather in a specific manner?
        - what is the legal framework?
        - what are the symbolic repertoires for public gatherings?
    * To which extent do the crowds make tactic choices in regards to timing and location?
    * beyond the scope of the paper/presentation

[^2]: {Thompson 2000@175-183}. This chapter is tellingly titled "Remapping the Urban Landscape". She augments her claim to the novelty of women leaving the house during Mandate times with a photograph (Illustration 13) that was taken in October 1918, i.e. right after the Ottoman withdrawal from Damascus and two years before the French Mandate; {Thompson 2000@183; iwm-205230434}.
