# Introduction
## Abstract

- Case study: periodical press of Damascus and Beirut, 1875–1914
- Background: prevalence of strong views, but lack of empirical studies on the press in *Bilād al-Shām*
- Argument: 
    + No dichotomy of Hamidian tyranny vs Young-Turk liberty of speech.
    + Instead: ever-increasing will and capability to effectively control the periodical press as well as a shared belief in the project of modernity among authors, readers, and regulators.
