# Introduction
## Abstract

- Case study: periodical press of Damascus and Beirut, 1875–1914
<!-- - Background: prevalence of strong views, but lack of empirical studies on the press in *Bilād al-Shām* -->
- Argument:
    + No dichotomy of Hamidian tyranny vs Young-Turk liberty of speech.
    + Instead: ever-increasing will and capability to effectively control the periodical press as well as a shared belief in the project of modernity among authors, readers, and regulators.

# Power of the norm
## Three phases

1. Establish and reiterate legal norms; 1850s, 1860s
2. Gather information and build institutions capable of enforcing these norms; 1880s, 1890s
3. Start enforcing them once legal norms have indeed become social normality; 1890s and especially 1909 onwards 

## Pre-1876: establishing the norms

- 1857, Jan: Law on Printing Presses (*maṭbaʿa niẓāmnāmesi*)
   <!--  + permits required for publishers
    + ban on "harmful" (*muẕarr*) publications -->
- **1864, 31 Dec: Law on Printed Material** (*maṭbūʿāt niẓāmnāmesi*)
    <!-- + permits required for periodicals
    + authorities must be supplied with copies *after* publication
    + regulation of permissible content
    + no institutionalised censorship but private litigation in the courts -->
<!-- 1867, Ḳararnāme-yi ʿAlī; {Boyar 2006@421} -->
- 1875, 10 Sep: Supplement
    <!-- + suspensions for false news, stiring the minds of the people (*teḫdīş-i eẕhān*) -->
<!-- - 1876, 12 Apr: decree published in the press; {Boyar 2006@421-422} without source
    + pre-publication censorship of the press --> 

## First constitutional period

- 1876, 23 Dec: first Ottoman constitution; abolished on Dec 11, 1879
    + art 12: "the press is free within the confines of the law" (*maṭbūʿāt ḳānūn dāʿiresinde serbesttir*)
<!-- - 1880, 19 December -->

## Hamidian period: setting-up the infrastructure

- 1888, 22 Jan: Law on Printing Presses
- **1894, 20 Nov: Law on Printing Presses**
    <!-- + abrogating the 1857 and 1888 laws
    + permits required for every part of the trade
        * permits continuously supervised by police and Directorate of Public Instruction
    + pre-publication permits required for all publications 
    + every part of the trade is fully liable to prosecution in case of transgressions
        * Police and judiciary tasked with enforcement
    + surveillance and random inspection of presses
    + supplying all relevant information in Ottoman
    + only periodicals' titles are allowed to be publicly announced in the streets -->
- 1901, Dec: *teẕkere* from the Ministry of the Interior
    <!-- + censorship (*murāqaba*) of periodicals is to be centralised at the Directorates of Printed Material (*mudīriye-yi maṭbūʿāt*)
    + all official publications are subjected to the same regime of censorship -->

# Second constitutional period
## 1908, the year of liberty?!

<div class="c_left c_width-60">
### yes

- 1908, 23 Jul: restoration of the constitution
    + Art 12: The press is free within the confines of the law
- 1908, 30 Jul: *ḫaṭṭ-ı hümāyūn* to the Grand Vezier
    + Art 7: Henceforth, newspapers are not subjected to censorship. They can circulate freely. Claims against newspapers can only be decided by courts
</div>

<div class="c_right c_width-30">
### but

- no publisher failed to obtain permits
</div>

## Renewed censorship

- 1909, Mar: *teẕkere* from Ministry of Justice
    <!-- + reminder that the various press laws had not been abolished -->
- 1909, 29 Jul: Law on Printing Presses (*maṭbaʿalar ḳānūnu*)
    <!-- + permits required
    + publications subject to approval by Ministries of the Interior & Education
    + enforced by penal courts and gendarmerie -->
- 1909, 29 Jul: Law on Printed Material (*maṭbūʿāt ḳānūnu*)
    <!-- + abrogating the 1864 law
    + permits required within a month
    + regulation of permissible content
    + all parts of the trade are liable to prosecution as if they were the authors
    + two copies of each issue to be supplied to the authorities
    + enforced by Ministry of the Interior, province, *mutaṣarriflik* -->
- 1909, 21 Aug: ammendment to art 12 of the constitution
    <!-- + periodcials cannot in any way be subject to control *before* (!) publication -->


# Practices of censorship
## Publication statistics: permissions

![Press censorship: permissive actions (1 = first issue, P = permit, PI = permit for import, PR = permit to resume publication, RP = republication)](../assets/censorship/rplot_levant-permissive.png)

## Publication statistics: restrictions

![Press censorship: repressive actions (BI = ban on import, CP = ceased publication, S = suspension, W = warning)](../assets/censorship/rplot_levant-restrictive.png)

## Publication statistics: suspensions

## Publication statistics: implemented suspensions

## Conclusion

- no dichotomy of Hamidian tyranny vs Young Turk liberty
- gradual convergence towards effective censorship with the expansion of a modern(ising) state and its institutions.
- importance of the 1894 legislation <!-- coinciding with "effective" censorship in *Bilād al-Shām* -->
- surprising freedoms during Hamidian era
- "re-"introduction of repressive legislation in 1909 and their effective implementation
- continuous importance of limiting factors
- continuous importance of the social consensus within the network of journalists-cum-officials-cum-entrepreneurs
